## 🔎 Project Overview
A DSA project to optimize loan settlements among multiple participants.  
Given many pairwise loans between people, the system computes a minimal set of transactions so everyone’s net balance becomes zero.

### Features
- Graph representation of transactions (adjacency list)
- Net balance calculation using hash map
- Priority queue (max-heap/min-heap) for largest creditors and debtors
- Greedy optimizer to minimize number of settlement transactions
- JSON-like backup (file I/O) and restore
- Java frontend for user interaction and notifications
